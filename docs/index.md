# Badges: Progress rewards

Badges is a **progress tracking** app for **Apple Watch**.

It lets you log progress on your **projects** or **activities** directly from your wrist.

You are **rewarded with badges** to create a tight positive feedback loop — even when there is no external validation yet.

Never forget your progress.
